# Paradise Search: explore your favorite brands' offshore tax schemes.

Paradise Search is based on public **open-source data** and shows you which company owns the brands on display, and how many **offshore subsidiaries** this company has in countries [flagged by the NGO Oxfam] (https://oi-files-d8-prod.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/file_attachments/bn-blacklist-whitewash-tax-havens-eu-281117-en_0.pdf) as "tax heavens".

This way, you can easily spot which brands represent a bigger risk of **your money "evaporating" offshore**. 

Paradise Search is not about telling you what is legal and what isn't, but to shed some light on major yet widely unknown companies' tax behavior. And to remind consumers: **you have the power to change things with informed decisions**. 

_To our knowledge and until proven otherwise, all the companies shown on the website are doing things by the book. There is a thin line between tax dodging (legal) and tax evasion (illegal), and it's not up to Paradise Search to draw it._
